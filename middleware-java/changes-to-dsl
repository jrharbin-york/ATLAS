src/atlasdsl/Mission.java 7: change to DSL for separate robots and computers, propagate back into spec
Components have separate properties for every type, needs to be reflected in DSL
Geometric basis properties should be part of the Region layer of the DSL? At the moment the coordinate origin is hardcoded into MOOSCommunity.genBasicMissionParams()
Speed limit in PHelmIvpProcess. Should be configured in the DSL for the robots
