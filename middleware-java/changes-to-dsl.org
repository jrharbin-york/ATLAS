* TODO src/atlasdsl/Mission.java 7: change to DSL for separate robots and computers, propagate back into spec
  Mission has Robots, Computers and Regions and EnvironmentalObjects
* TODO Components have separate properties for every type, needs to be reflected in DSL
  intProperties, doubleProperties, pointProperties, stringProperties
* TODO Geometric basis properties should be part of the Region layer of the DSL? At the moment the coordinate origin is hardcoded into MOOSCommunity.genBasicMissionParams()
  geometric base of coordinates - should be specified for a Region?
* TODO Changes to the Mission layer - need to propagate back into DSL
