Fault implementation

* Fault in the polygon computation/transmission to the UUV
Distort the polygon computation list - ListMessageChange - seperators etc, composite fields
MutateMessage should have a descriptor for subfields etc
Add class SubfieldSpec
null reference 
descriptor character
random selection
fixed selection


Needs to be a change 

* UUV component/navigation failure
Overriding the speed/heading in the MOOSDB

* Fault in the location message updates
Distort the location recording from the message before passing it to the CI
Quick hack - add an error to the message update according to the faults
Proper implementation would distort the messages at the middleware

* Failure of the detection messages
Ignoring the detection messages at the middleware
Proper implementation would use forwards the pShare messages via the middleware - 
allowing it to delete some or pass them away

* Sensor failure
Ignoring the detections at the middleware
For degraded performance, new components will have to be developed


* The middleware has to handle forwarded CI requests so the faults can be injected
